# Introduction
This repository provides the code of a binary classifier that is well documented, tested and was part of the [Kaggle: American Express - Default Prediction challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/). The classifier scored rank 4086 due to its simplicity. 

# Tests
Two data generators:
* sinus
* negative number

# American Express challenge
