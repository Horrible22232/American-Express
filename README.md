# Introduction
This repository provides the code of a binary classifier that is well documented, tested and was part of the [Kaggle: American Express - Default Prediction challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/). The classifier scored rank 4086 due to its simplicity. 

# Contributions
The contributions are as follows:
* Binary classfier
* Optional recurrent encoder => Can be used for sequential data

# Tests
The classifier got tested under two artificial problems:
* In the first problem, the classifier should 

Two data generators:
* sinus
* negative number

# American Express Challenge
* Used model

# Future Work

# Try it out!
